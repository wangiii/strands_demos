    "\n",
    "Many developers find agentic AI difficult, so the new SDK is meant to help them deploy the technology and connect models and tools. The toolkit also aligns with AWS' SDLC strategy.\n",
    "Esther Shittu\n",
    "By\n",
    "Esther Shittu, News Writer\n",
    "Published: 16 May 2025\n",
    "AWS on Friday introduced Strands Agents, an open source SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strands Agents is a model-driven toolkit for building and running AI agents with a few lines of code, according to AWS. With Strands, developers can define a prompt and a list of tools in code to build an agent, test it and deploy it to the cloud, the vendor said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS said the SDK connects the two components: the model and tools. It plans the agent's next steps and executes tools with advanced reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic challenges for developers\n",
    "Strands Agents is AWS's attempt to help developers integrate agentic AI into their workflows. Currently, developers have divergent points of view regarding agentic AI tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Some embrace it and some remain skeptical,\" said Rachel Stephens, an analyst at RedMonk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the challenge is that many developers find the current approach of developing and managing an agentic workflow difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Application developers struggle to find the right balance between taking advantage of the flexibility of LLM [large language model]-driven task execution on the one hand and controlling the probabilistic character of the results of these agent workflows on the other,\" said Torsten Volk, an analyst at Omdia, a division of Informa TechTarget.\n",
    "\n",
    "He added that workflow-based tools often require more skill and expertise than typically found in an enterprise, meaning many AI projects face the threat of abandonment. With Strands, AWS promises developers do not need \"hardcoded workflows,\" Volk continued. Instead, they can use an LLM of their choice to complete their tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Developers will be drawn by Strands if it manages to replace complex workflows with a simpler approach that relies on LLMs to structure how models are used, thoughts are chained and tools are called,\" Volk said. \"The availability of a large tool library will be another important factor, as tool integration is another critical developer pain point.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS strategy\n",
    "Strands Agents also aligns with AWS's strategy of integrating better with the software development lifecycle (SDLC).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"AWS has long been a destination for production code but has historically struggled to gain traction as a center of gravity for other parts of the SDLC,\" Stephens said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cloud provider has recently addressed this with launches that include agent integrations into GitLab and GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"These integrations indicate an ecosystem focus and an intention to build integrations that stretch across the SDLC,\" Stephens continued. She added that Strands Agents is also an SDLC play.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It's designed to help developers design and build agents, test them locally and deploy them to the cloud,\" she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration angle is more tangential, although AWS uses independent generative AI vendor Anthropic's model complex protocol (MCP), \"which opens a lot of ecosystem doors,\" Stephens said. \"MCP is the de facto standard for connecting agentic tools.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Strands Agents can run anywhere and support any model with reasoning and tool use capabilities, including models in Amazon Bedrock and Ollama. As an open source system, Strands Agents includes contributions from others in the community, including Accenture, Anthropic, Meta and PwC. Developers can start using the tools on GitHub now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, OpenAI on Friday introduced Codex, a cloud-based software engineering agent that can work on tasks such as writing features, answering questions about a codebase and fixing bugs in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is powered by codex-1, a version of OpenAI's o3 LLM that is optimized for software engineering and trained with reinforcement learning, OpenAI said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new agent will now be rolled out to ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise and Team users. Plus and Edu users will soon be able to use it, too.\n",

      "# AWS推出Strands Agents SDK\n",
      "\n",
      "许多开发者发现代理型人工智能难以使用，因此新的SDK旨在帮助他们部署该技术并连接模型和工具。该工具包还与AWS的SDLC策略保持一致。\n",
      "\n",
      "Esther Shittu\n",
      "作者：Esther Shittu，新闻记者\n",
      "发布日期：2025年5月16日\n",
      "\n",
      "AWS周五推出了Strands Agents，一个开源SDK。\n",
      "\n",
      "据AWS介绍，Strands Agents是一个模型驱动的工具包，用几行代码构建和运行AI代理。使用Strands，开发者可以定义提示和工具列表来构建代理，测试它并将其部署到云端。\n",
      "\n",
      "AWS表示，该SDK连接了两个组件：模型和工具。它计划代理的下一步行动并使用先进的推理能力执行工具。\n",
      "\n",
      "开发者面临的代理挑战\n",
      "Strands Agents是AWS帮助开发者将代理型AI整合到工作流程中的尝试。目前，开发者对代理型AI工具持有不同观点。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"有些人欣然接受，有些人则保持怀疑，\"RedMonk分析师Rachel Stephens表示。\n",
      "\n",
      "部分挑战在于，许多开发者发现目前开发和管理代理工作流的方法很困难。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"应用程序开发者在一方面利用LLM（大型语言模型）驱动的任务执行灵活性和另一方面控制这些代理工作流结果的概率特性之间，难以找到正确平衡，\"Omdia（Informa TechTarget的一个部门）分析师Torsten Volk说。\n",
      "\n",
      "他补充说，基于工作流的工具通常需要比企业中典型找到的更多技能和专业知识，这意味着许多AI项目面临被放弃的威胁。通过Strands，AWS承诺开发者不需要\"硬编码工作流\"，Volk继续说。相反，他们可以使用自己选择的LLM来完成任务。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"如果Strands能够用一种更简单的方法替代复杂工作流，依靠LLM来构建如何使用模型、思考链和调用工具，开发者会被吸引，\"Volk说。\"大型工具库的可用性将是另一个重要因素，因为工具集成是另一个关键的开发者痛点。\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## AWS策略\n",
      "Strands Agents还与AWS更好地集成软件开发生命周期（SDLC）的战略保持一致。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"AWS长期以来一直是生产代码的目的地，但历史上难以在SDLC其他部分获得牵引力，\"Stephens说。\n",
      "\n",
      "该云提供商最近通过包括将代理集成到GitLab和GitHub中的发布来解决这一问题。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"这些集成表明了生态系统焦点和构建贯穿SDLC的集成的意图，\"Stephens继续说。她补充说，Strands Agents也是SDLC的一部分。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"它旨在帮助开发者设计和构建代理，在本地测试它们并将它们部署到云端，\"她说。\n",
      "\n",
      "虽然集成角度更为切线，但AWS使用独立生成式AI供应商Anthropic的模型复杂协议（MCP），\"这打开了许多生态系统的门，\"Stephens说。\"MCP是连接代理工具的事实标准。\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Strands Agents可以在任何地方运行，并支持任何具有推理和工具使用能力的模型，包括Amazon Bedrock和Ollama中的模型。作为开源系统，Strands Agents包括来自社区其他成员的贡献，包括埃森哲、Anthropic、Meta和普华永道。开发者现在可以在GitHub上开始使用这些工具。\n",
      "\n",
      "与此同时，OpenAI周五推出了Codex，一个基于云的软件工程代理，可以并行处理编写功能、回答关于代码库的问题和修复错误等任务。\n",
      "\n",
      "它由codex-1提供支持，这是OpenAI的o3 LLM的一个版本，针对软件工程进行了优化，并通过强化学习进行了训练，OpenAI表示。\n",
      "\n",
      "新代理现在将向ChatGPT Pro、Enterprise和Team用户推出。Plus和Edu用户也将很快能够使用它。\n",

      "许多开发者发现代理人工智能很困难，因此这个新SDK旨在帮助他们部署该技术并连接模型和工具。该工具包还与AWS的SDLC战略保持一致。\n",
      "Esther Shittu\n",
      "作者：\n",
      "Esther Shittu，新闻作者\n",
      "发布时间：2025年5月16日\n",
      "AWS于周五推出了Strands Agents，一个开源SDK。\n",
      "\n",
      "据AWS介绍，Strands Agents是一个模型驱动的工具包，用于通过几行代码构建和运行AI代理。使用Strands，开发者可以定义提示和工具列表来构建代理，测试它并将其部署到云端。\n",
      "\n",
      "AWS表示，该SDK连接了两个组件：模型和工具。它规划代理的下一步行动并以先进的推理能力执行工具。\n",
      "\n",
      "开发者面临的代理挑战\n",
      "Strands Agents是AWS帮助开发者将代理AI整合到其工作流程中的尝试。目前，开发者对代理AI工具有不同的观点。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"有些人接受它，有些人则持怀疑态度，\"RedMonk分析师Rachel Stephens说。\n",
      "\n",
      "部分挑战在于许多开发者发现目前开发和管理代理工作流程的方法很困难。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"应用程序开发者一方面努力在利用LLM（大型语言模型）驱动的任务执行的灵活性，另一方面控制这些代理工作流程结果的概率特性之间找到正确的平衡，\"Informa TechTarget旗下Omdia的分析师Torsten Volk说。\n",
      "\n",
      "他补充说，基于工作流程的工具通常需要比企业通常拥有的更多技能和专业知识，这意味着许多AI项目面临被放弃的威胁。Volk继续表示，通过Strands，AWS承诺开发者不需要\"硬编码工作流程\"。相反，他们可以使用自己选择的LLM来完成任务。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"如果Strands能够用更简单的方法替代复杂的工作流程，依靠LLM来构建模型使用方式、思维链接和工具调用，开发者将会被吸引，\"Volk说。\"大型工具库的可用性也将是另一个重要因素，因为工具集成是另一个关键的开发者痛点。\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## AWS战略\n",
      "Strands Agents也与AWS更好地集成软件开发生命周期(SDLC)的战略相一致。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"AWS长期以来一直是生产代码的目的地，但历史上难以在SDLC的其他部分获得关注，\"Stephens说。\n",
      "\n",
      "该云提供商最近通过包括将代理集成到GitLab和GitHub的发布来解决这个问题。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"这些集成表明了生态系统重点和构建跨SDLC集成的意图，\"Stephens继续说。她补充说，Strands Agents也是SDLC产品。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"它旨在帮助开发者设计和构建代理，在本地测试并部署到云端，\"她说。\n",
      "\n",
      "集成角度更为间接，尽管AWS使用独立生成式AI供应商Anthropic的模型复杂协议(MCP)，\"这打开了许多生态系统的大门，\"Stephens说。\"MCP是连接代理工具的事实标准。\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Strands Agents可以在任何地方运行，支持任何具有推理和工具使用能力的模型，包括Amazon Bedrock和Ollama中的模型。作为开源系统，Strands Agents包括来自社区其他成员的贡献，包括埃森哲、Anthropic、Meta和普华永道。开发者现在可以在GitHub上开始使用这些工具。\n",
      "\n",
      "同时，OpenAI周五推出了Codex，这是一个基于云的软件工程代理，可以同时处理编写功能、回答关于代码库的问题和修复bug等任务。\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall, this is a high-quality translation of the AWS Strands Agents SDK article from English to Chinese. Here are my observations and suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "1. The technical terminology is accurately translated (e.g., SDK, SDLC, LLM, etc.)\n",
      "2. The structure of the original article is well preserved\n",
      "3. The translation maintains a professional tone appropriate for a tech news article\n",
      "4. Names and company references are correctly kept in their original form\n",
      "\n",
      "### Areas for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Term consistency**:\n",
      "   - The term \"agentic AI\" is translated as \"代理人工智能\" - this is accurate but could be more consistent with how AWS might refer to it in Chinese. Consider using \"智能代理AI\" if that's the standard term used by AWS in Chinese materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Phrases that could be more idiomatic**:\n",
      "   - \"面临被放弃的威胁\" (face the threat of abandonment) - while accurate, a more natural Chinese expression might be \"面临被搁置的风险\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Date format**:\n",
      "   - \"2025年5月16日\" follows Chinese convention but you might want to check if there's a preferred format for tech publications\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Technical clarifications**:\n",
      "   - When translating \"model complex protocol (MCP)\", you maintained \"模型复杂协议(MCP)\" which is literal but might not be the standard Chinese term. Consider verifying if there's an official Chinese translation for this protocol term.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Minor syntax issues**:\n",
      "   - In the sentence \"Volk继续表示，通过Strands，AWS承诺开发者不需要'硬编码工作流程'\", the structure is slightly awkward. A more natural flow might be \"通过Strands，AWS承诺开发者不需要'硬编码工作流程'，Volk继续表示\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The translation is accurate and professional, maintaining the technical integrity of the original article while being readable for Chinese audiences. With minor adjustments to some expressions, it would be publication-ready.# AWS推出Strands Agents SDK\n",
      "\n",
      "许多开发者发现智能代理AI很困难，因此这个新SDK旨在帮助他们部署该技术并连接模型和工具。该工具包还与AWS的SDLC战略保持一致。\n",

      "发布时间：2025年5月16日\n",
      "AWS于周五推出了Strands Agents，一个开源SDK。\n",
      "\n",
      "据AWS介绍，Strands Agents是一个模型驱动的工具包，用于通过几行代码构建和运行AI代理。使用Strands，开发者可以定义提示和工具列表来构建代理，测试它并将其部署到云端。\n",
      "\n",
      "AWS表示，该SDK连接了两个组件：模型和工具。它规划代理的下一步行动并以先进的推理能力执行工具。\n",
      "\n",
      "开发者面临的代理挑战\n",
      "Strands Agents是AWS帮助开发者将智能代理AI整合到其工作流程中的尝试。目前，开发者对智能代理AI工具有不同的观点。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"有些人接受它，有些人则持怀疑态度，\"RedMonk分析师Rachel Stephens说。\n",
      "\n",
      "部分挑战在于许多开发者发现目前开发和管理代理工作流程的方法很困难。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"应用程序开发者一方面努力在利用LLM（大型语言模型）驱动的任务执行的灵活性，另一方面控制这些代理工作流程结果的概率特性之间找到正确的平衡，\"Informa TechTarget旗下Omdia的分析师Torsten Volk说。\n",
      "\n",
      "他补充说，基于工作流程的工具通常需要比企业通常拥有的更多技能和专业知识，这意味着许多AI项目面临被搁置的风险。通过Strands，AWS承诺开发者不需要\"硬编码工作流程\"，Volk继续表示。相反，他们可以使用自己选择的LLM来完成任务。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"如果Strands能够用更简单的方法替代复杂的工作流程，依靠LLM来构建模型使用方式、思维链接和工具调用，开发者将会被吸引，\"Volk说。\"大型工具库的可用性也将是另一个重要因素，因为工具集成是另一个关键的开发者痛点。\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## AWS战略\n",
      "Strands Agents也与AWS更好地集成软件开发生命周期(SDLC)的战略相一致。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"AWS长期以来一直是生产代码的目的地，但历史上难以在SDLC的其他部分获得关注，\"Stephens说。\n",
      "\n",
      "该云提供商最近通过包括将代理集成到GitLab和GitHub的发布来解决这个问题。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"这些集成表明了生态系统重点和构建跨SDLC集成的意图，\"Stephens继续说。她补充说，Strands Agents也是SDLC产品。\n",
      "\n",
      "\"它旨在帮助开发者设计和构建代理，在本地测试并部署到云端，\"她说。\n",
      "\n",
      "集成角度更为间接，尽管AWS使用独立生成式AI供应商Anthropic的模型通信协议(MCP)，\"这打开了许多生态系统的大门，\"Stephens说。\"MCP是连接代理工具的事实标准。\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Strands Agents可以在任何地方运行，支持任何具有推理和工具使用能力的模型，包括Amazon Bedrock和Ollama中的模型。作为开源系统，Strands Agents包括来自社区其他成员的贡献，包括埃森哲、Anthropic、Meta和普华永道。开发者现在可以在GitHub上开始使用这些工具。\n",
      "\n",
      "同时，OpenAI周五推出了Codex，这是一个基于云的软件工程代理，可以同时处理编写功能、回答关于代码库的问题和修复bug等任务。\n",
      "\n",
      "它由codex-1驱动，这是OpenAI的o3 LLM的一个版本，为软件工程优化并通过强化学习训练，OpenAI表示。\n",
      "\n",
      "这个新代理现在将向ChatGPT Pro、Enterprise和Team用户推出。Plus和Edu用户很快也将能够使用它。\n",
