      "\n",
      "Your identification of research gaps is particularly valuable. I agree that incorporating longitudinal studies will provide crucial insights into how these effects evolve over time. The cross-cultural perspective is essential - we've been overly focused on Western contexts when adoption patterns and cultural frameworks for AI integration differ substantially worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your point about power dynamics is especially insightful. We should examine how technical literacy and access create relationship imbalances - potentially reinforcing existing socioeconomic divides in relationship satisfaction and communication efficacy.\n",

      "## Implementation Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "For your suggested research questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **AI disclosure patterns:** We could design experimental studies comparing relationship development across conditions where AI assistance is disclosed at different stages. This could illuminate trust formation mechanisms.\n",

      "### Experience Sampling Implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "**Frequency of Data Collection:**\n",
      "- **Initial Intensive Period**: 3-5 prompts daily for 14 days to establish baseline patterns\n",
      "- **Sustained Monitoring**: Reduction to 1-2 daily prompts for 4-6 weeks\n",
      "- **Longitudinal Follow-up**: Weekly check-ins for 3-6 months to track relationship evolution\n",

      "One aspect we should add to our framework is examining generational differences. Initial evidence suggests significantly different comfort levels and usage patterns between age cohorts.

      "### Measurement Approaches\n",
      "- Consider incorporating implicit measures of trust alongside explicit self-reports to capture unconscious attitudes (e.g., response latency tests, behavioral trust games)\n",
      "- Use validated relationship authenticity scales (e.g., Kernis & Goldman's Authenticity Inventory) supplemented with new items specific to AI-mediated communication\n",
